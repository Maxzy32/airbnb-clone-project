## 🗃️ Database Design

The database schema for the AirBnB Clone Project is designed to support user interaction, property listings, and transactions. Below are the key entities and their fields:

### 👤 Users
Stores information about all registered users.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (host or guest)

### 🏠 Properties
Stores details about properties listed by hosts.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

### 📅 Bookings
Tracks reservations made by guests.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

### 💬 Reviews
Allows guests to leave feedback on properties they have booked.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)
- `rating` (1 to 5)
- `comment`

### 💳 Payments
Records payment transactions for bookings.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)
- `payment_date`
- `amount`
- `payment_method` (e.g., card, PayPal)

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can be a **host** (who owns properties) or a **guest** (who makes bookings).
- A **User** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Property** belongs to one **User** (the host), but can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking**.



## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project is structured around several core features that replicate the functionality of the real AirBnB platform. Each feature plays an important role in delivering a complete user experience.

### 👥 User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It ensures secure authentication and enables role-based access for both guests and hosts.

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can list properties by providing details such as title, description, location, price, and images. This feature enables property owners to manage their listings and updates.

### 📆 Booking System
Guests can book available properties for specific dates. The system checks for availability, calculates total costs, and stores booking records, ensuring a smooth reservation process.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Enables users to pay for bookings securely using various payment methods. This ensures that transactions are safely recorded and linked to the correct bookings.

### 💬 Review & Rating System
After a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings on properties. This helps maintain quality control and gives feedback to future users.

### 🔍 Search & Filter
Allows users to search for properties based on location, price range, availability, and other filters. This enhances user experience by helping them find suitable listings quickly.

### 📱 Responsive UI
Ensures that the application is fully functional and visually appealing across different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.





## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of any application that handles sensitive user data and financial transactions. The Airbnb Clone project will implement several key security measures to ensure data privacy, integrity, and protection from malicious attacks.

### ✅ Authentication
We will use token-based authentication (such as JWT) to verify user identities. This ensures that only registered users can access restricted endpoints, such as booking a property or viewing personal data.

### ✅ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to restrict actions based on user roles (guest vs. host vs. admin). For example, only hosts can manage listings, and only the booking user can cancel a reservation.

### ✅ Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the API will implement rate limiting. This limits how many requests a user can make in a specific time frame.

### ✅ Data Validation & Sanitization
All incoming API data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

### ✅ HTTPS & Secure Headers
The application will enforce HTTPS for encrypted communication. Additionally, HTTP security headers (like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.) will be configured to reduce common vulnerabilities.

### ✅ Secure Payments
Payment endpoints will be secured with strong validation and encryption to ensure sensitive financial data is handled safely and never exposed.

---

**Why This Matters:**
- 🛡️ **Protecting User Data**: Prevent unauthorized access to personal details, login credentials, and booking history.
- 💳 **Securing Payments**: Ensure the safety and trustworthiness of financial transactions.
- 🧱 **Preventing Abuse**: Mitigate spamming, automated attacks, and misuse of APIs.



## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice that allows teams to automate the process of integrating code, running tests, and deploying applications.

- **Continuous Integration** ensures that every change made to the codebase is automatically tested and integrated into the main branch without conflicts.
- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery** automatically delivers tested code to production or staging environments, reducing manual effort and deployment errors.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will:
- Enable faster and safer releases of new features and bug fixes.
- Help maintain a high-quality codebase by running automated tests on every commit.
- Reduce manual deployment work and minimize downtime.
- Make it easier to collaborate in a team environment.

### Tools to Be Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate workflows such as building, testing, and deploying code directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Heroku / Vercel / Render**: Platforms to automatically deploy backend and frontend apps when new changes are pushed.
- **Postman/Newman**: For automating API test scripts as part of the CI flow.
